// A collection of styling decisions that affect the overall "feel" of the
// application as a whole.

// To provide a more "app-like" experience, text-selection is disabled by
// default. It can be re-enabled with the `.allow-select()` mixin.

// All input selection should be allowed, and this needs to be overridden to
// prevent browsers from making it impossible to select anything at all.
// Paragraph text is relatively rare in this webapp, and generally will be used
// in a context where selecting text would be sensible and applicable.
